Forked from version 0.7.1 of SCInsta. I have included a built IPA [here](https://github.com/harrybbdev/SCInsta-PasswordProtected/releases)

As the description says, this adds a small password section into the Security section that lets you lock the SCInsta settings behind a custom password. While the features of SCInsta are fantastic, I found it was all too easy to just re-active the Explore page and get sucked back into doomscrolling without a lot of willpower. Therefore, by adding a password lock on the settings (and choosing a difficult to remember password), you essentially increase the barrier for you to turn those settings back on.

# Notifications don't work, what do?

You can use eSign on iOS to sign the IPA with a p12 and mobileconfiguration files. Make sure to enable push notifications when doing so (this may require a developer account).
