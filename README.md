Forked from version 0.7.1 of SCInsta. I have included a built IPA **here**

As the description says, this adds a small password section into the Security section that lets you lock the SCInsta settings behind a custom password. I needed this because I communicate and share memes with my friends on Instagram, but would often find myself getting sucked into Reels in an unhealthy way. I didn't want to completely delete Instagram, however I did need a way to block the unhealthy parts of the app from the screen, primarily the Explore page. With this fork, I basically just vibe coded a very hacky solution on top of SCInsta to add this in (I am a programmer but I have no knowledge in this area, so I just did it in the quickest way possible).
